.  G                        G/B   C                G
 I heard an old, old story, How a Savior came from glory,
.       Em               G          A                  D
 How He gave His life on Calvary To save a wretch like me;
.  G                        G/B    C                 G
 I heard about His groaning Of His precious blood's atoning,
.     Em         G              C6      Dsus D G
 Then I repented of my sins and won the vic__tory.

[C]
.  G                   C          G
 O victory in Jesus my Savior, forever!
.   Em            G              A             D
 He sought me and bought me with His redeeming blood;
.   G                            C              G
 He loved me ere I knew Him, and all my love is due Him
.                           C         Dsus D    G
 He plunged me to victory beneath the cleansing flood.

[v2]
.  G                        G/B    C                 G
 I heard about His healing, Of His cleansing power revealing,
.       Em               G              A                   D
 How He made the lame to walk again And caused the blind to see;
.    G                         G/B      C              G
 And then I cried "Dear Jesus, Come and heal my broken spirit,"
.    Em            G                   C6     Dsus D G
 And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the vic__tory.

[V3]
.  G                     G/B    C               G
 I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory,
.      Em              G                 A                D
 And I heard about the streets of gold Beyond the crystal sea;
. G                       G/B     C              G
 About the angels singing And the old redemption story,
.    Em                  G                 C6      Dsus D G
 And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of vic__tory.</lyrics></song>
