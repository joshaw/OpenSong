  <lyrics>[V]
.A         E          F#m            E         D
 My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like You;
.          A     D         A                          G   Bm E
 All of my days, I want to praise the wonders of Your mighty love.||

.A           E           F#m      E          D
 My comfort, my shelter, Tower of refuge and strength;
.          A       D          A                  G  Bm   E
 Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship You.

[C]
.A            F#m           D            E
 Shout to the Lord, all the earth let us sing,
.A         F#m      D             E
 Power and majesty, praise to the King
.F#m                        D
 Mountains bow down and the seas will roar,
.       E     F#m     E
 At the sound of Your name||

.A          F#m        D            E
 I sing for joy at the work of Your hands;
.   A         F#m          D         E
 Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand;
.A          F#m          D         E       A
 Nothing compares to the promise I have in You.</lyrics></song>
