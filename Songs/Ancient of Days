 Blessing and honor, glory and power,

 Be unto the Ancient of Days;

 Bow before the Ancient of Days.

 Every tongue in heaven and earth shall declare Your glory,
.G                Em7         A         D  A
 Every knee shall bow at Your throne in worship,
.G              Em7     A    D   A    G             Em7       A
 You will be exalted, O God, and Your kingdom shall not pass away;

 O Ancient of Days.

 For none can compare to Your matchless worth,
.C             G          A
 Sing unto the Ancient of Days.</lyrics></song>
