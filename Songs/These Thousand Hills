  <lyrics>[V1]
.               G                              D
 These thousand hills roll ever on: footprints of a Mighty God;
.              G              C               G   D         G
 They bring me to my knees in praise, amazing love, amazing grace.

[V2]
.         G                             D
 Was on a hill my Savior died, a broken heart and bleeding side;
.            G                 C                G   D             G
 Hill of the Skull, Mount Calvary, the blood He shed, He shed for me.

[V3]
.              G                             D
 When Heaven's hills at last I roam, forever settled in my home;
.              G                  C                     G   D            G
 I'll join the saints around Your throne, Your kingdom, Lord, rolls ever on.

[V4]
.               G                           D
 These thousand hills roll ever on: ripples of a coming storm;
.            G                 C                    G    D          G
 The morning star precedes the dawn, these thousand hills roll ever on.</lyrics></song>
