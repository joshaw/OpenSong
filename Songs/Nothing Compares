.A          E       F#m
1I've heard all the stories
2I see      all the people
.A         E         F#m
1I've seen all the   signs
2Wasting   all their time
.A         E        F#m
1Witnessed all the  glory
2Building  up their riches
.A      E           F#m
1Tasted all that's  fine
2For a  life that's fine

.        A       E       Bm           D            A   E Bm
 Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord
.        A       E       Bm           D            A   E Bm
 Nothing compares to the greatness of knowing You, Lord

[B]
.      Bm               D            E
 And I find myself just living for today
.         Bm                D              E
 'Cause I don't know what tomorrow's gonna bring
.      Bm          D                 A         E        G
 So no matter if I rise or fall I'll never be alone, oh no...</lyrics></song>
