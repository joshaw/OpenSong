  <lyrics>[V1]
.G               Am/C D      G        C D      G      D A      D
 And can be that I    should gain,|an interest in the Savior's blood?
.D           G/D     G/B        D         C       G      D        G
 Died He for me, who caused His pain?|For me, who Him to death pursued?
.G       G/D       C   A  D   
 Amazing love, how can it be
.     G       C             D       G     
 That thou my Lord shouldst die for me?
 
[C]
. G      D         C      G
 Amazing love, how can it be
.     C       G   Am       C   D   G
 That thou my God shouldst die for me?
 
[V2]
.G                  Am/C D   G         C     D  G       D A      D
 Long my imprisoned spi__rit lay,|Fast bound in sin and nature's night,
.D            G/D     G/B        D      C         G       D           G
 Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,|I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
.G              G/D     C     A   D
 My chains fell off, my heart was free,
.  G          C         D        G
 I rose, went forth and followed thee.
 
[V3]
.G               Am/C D G        C    D   G      D    A  D
 No condemnation now  I dread,|Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;
.D        G/D     G/B    D        C            G        D      G
 Alive in Him, my living Head|and clothed with righteousness divine,
.G        G/D         C  A   D
 Bold I approach the eternal throne,
.    G         C             D          G
 And claim the crown through Christ, my own.</lyrics>
