.Em                B7          Em
1We three kings of Orient      are
2Born a king on    Bethlehem's plain.
3Frankincense to   offer have  I.
4Myrrh is mine its bitter per__fume
5Glorious now be___hold Him a__rise,
.Em                 B7         Em
1Bearing gifts we   traverse a_far;
2Gold I bring to    crown him again.
3Incense owns a     deity     night.
4Breathes a life of gathering gloom
4King and God, and  sacri_____fice;
.Em         D         G         G/B
1Field and  fountain, moor and  mountain
2King for___ever      ceasing   never.
3Prayer and praising, all men   raising;
4Sorrowing, sighing,  bleeding, dying
5Alle_______luia,     alle______luia,
.Am            Em/B   B7   Em
1Following     yon____der  star.
2Over us       all    to   reign.
3Worship Him,  God    on   high.
4Sealed in the stone  cold tomb.
5Earth to      heav'n re___plies.

 Oooooohhhhhh,
.G              C       G
 Star of wonder star of night
.G               C      G
 Star with royal beauty bright
.Em       D       C        D
 Westward leading still proceeding
.G               C       G
 Guide us to thy perfect light.</lyrics></song>
