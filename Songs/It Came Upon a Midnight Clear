  <lyrics>[V1]
 It came upon the midnight clear
 That glorious song of old
 From angels bending near the earth
 To touch their harps of gold
 Peace on the earth good will to men
 From heaven's all gracious King
 The world in solemn stillness lay
 To hear the angels sing
 
[V2]
 Still thro' the cloven skies they come
 With peaceful wings unfurled
 And still their heavenly music floats
 O'er all the weary world
 Above its sad and lowly plains
 They bend on hovering wing
 And ever o'er its Babel sounds
 The blessed angels sing
 
[V3]
 And ye beneath life's crushing load
 Whose forms are bending low
 Who toil along the climbing way
 With painful steps and slow
 Look now for glad and golden hours
 Come swiftly on the wing
 O rest beside the weary road
 And hear the angels sing
 
[V4]
 For lo the days are hastening on
 By prophet bards foretold
 When with the ever-circling years
 Comes round the age of gold
 When peace shall over all the earth
 Its ancient splendors fling
 And the whole world give back the song
 Which now the angels sing
 
[V5]
 Yet with the woes of sin and strife
 The world has suffered long
 Beneath the angel strain have rolled
 Two thousand years of wrong
 And man at war with man hears not
 The love song which they bring
 O hush the noise ye men of strife
 And hear the angels sing</lyrics>
