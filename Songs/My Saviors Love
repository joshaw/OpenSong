  <lyrics>[V1]
.     G
1I    stand amazed in the presence
2He   took my sins and my sorrows,
3When with the ransomed in glory
.    D                    G
1Of  Jesus the Naza_______rene,
2He  made them His very   own;
3His face I at last shall see,
.       C                     G
1And    wonder how He could   love me,
2He     bore the burden to    Calvary,
3`Twill be my joy through the ages
.                 D         G
1A sinner, con____demned, unclean.
2And suffered and died a____lone.
3To sing of His   love for  me.
