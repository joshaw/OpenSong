.C#m               E                         A            E
1I'm here with the others who saw the        heavens testify
2He raises a       wrinkled hand through the dust and the flies
.C#m                  E                A            B                 C#m
1Now I hang back      in the shadows I want to come close, I want to  know
2Wrapped in rags like we are|and with  barely open  eyes, He takes my finger
.            E                   A                 E
1She sees me shivering here, she smiles and with a nod
2And He      won't let go and he won't let         go
.C#m                 E                    A              E
1I walk through the  mud and straw to the newborn Son of God
2It's nothing like I knew before and it's all I need to  know

 Come let us adore Him, He has come down to this barren land
.         B
 Where we live
.          A               B   A    E
 And all I have to give Him is Adoration
