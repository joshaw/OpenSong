.Am                        Dm               G                                  C
1Many years ago I was      petrified, I was stealing, lusting, blaspheming and telling many lies
2And I'm free to stay with You, Light has   come into my life, our re__________lationship brand new
.      F                                    Dm
1I was on my way to Hell all be_____________cause of my great sin,
2You   said You'd never leave me, and You'd never let me go
.         E
1Then You came into my life, I just had to let You in||
2That's   why my eyes are on You, that's why You are my Lord.||

.        Am             Dm             G                                C
1So come on, walk in my door, when You touched my heart oh Lord, all my tears began to flow
2So let  me, stay on my knees, always  keep me close to You, hold me    Jesus, will You please?
.        F                              Dm
1No more hopeless days and nights of my being all alone,
2Your    precious life You gave, and    by Your blood You save
.      E
1      Now You're in my life and I'm a part of Your great home
2I'm redeemed, and from prison I'm set free!

.   Am       Dm         G                             C
 Oh I, I am alive, once dead in my great sin, now I'm happy by Your side
.   F                     Dm
 Forever I will live, one day will do no wrong
.     E
 I'll be with You forever, and in my heart there is a song||

.   Am       Dm         G                             C
 Oh I, I am alive, once dead in my great sin, now I'm happy by Your side
.   F                     Dm
 Forever I will live, one day will do no wrong
.      E
 I am alive, I am alive! Hey, hey!</lyrics></song>
