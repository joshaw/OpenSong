.D      G             D             G
 I will call upon the Lord, (I will call upon the Lord,)

 Who is worthy to be praised; (Who is worthy to be praised;)
.D        G    D             G            D             G
 So shall I be saved from my enemies; (Be saved from my enemies;)
.D      G             D
 I will call upon the Lord.

.    D                G              D
 The Lord liveth, and blessed be the rock,
.            G            D         A7
 And let the God of my salvation be exalted;

 And let the God of my salvation be exalted.

.D       G               D             G               D
 He will save me from my sin; (He will save me from my sin;)
.D        G    D             G                D             G
 So shall I proclaim him the Lord of all, (Proclaim him the Lord of all,)

 I will learn to trust the Lord.</lyrics></song>
