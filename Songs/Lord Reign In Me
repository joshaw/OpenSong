  <lyrics>[V1]
.A    E       D          E        A
 Over all the earth, You reign on high,
.      E        D             E      F#m7
 Every mountain stream, every sunset sky;
.       E     D               E    F#m7
 But my one request, Lord, my only aim,
.            D        E   A
 Is that You reign in me again.

[C]
.A     E        D         E       A
 Lord, reign in me, reign in Your power;
.     E      D             E       F#m7
 Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour,
.    E       D       E     F#m7
 You are the Lord of all I am,
.             D        E   A    E D A E D
 So won't You reign in me again.

[V2]
.A    E     D             E     A
 Over every thought, over every word,
.       E      D                E     F#m7
 May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord;
.                E       D           E       F#m7
 'Cause You mean more to me than any earthly thing,
.             D        E   A
 So won't You reign in me again.</lyrics></song>
