.D
 Over the mountains and the sea
.Em 
 Your river runs with love for me
.G                     A
 And I will open up my heart
.
 And let the Healer set me free||
.D
 I'm happy to be in the truth
.Em 
 And I will daily lift my hands
.G
 For I will always sing
.   A
 Of when Your love came down

[C]
.D                    Em 
 I could sing of Your love forever
.G                    A
 I could sing of Your love forever
.D                    Em 
 I could sing of Your love forever
.G                    A
 I could sing of Your love forever

[B]
.Em             D/F#
 Oh I feel like dancing
.G                  A
 It's foolishness I know
.Em                     D/F#
 But when the world has seen the light
.          G                         A
 They will dance with joy like we're dancing now</lyrics></song>
