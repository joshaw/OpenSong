  <lyrics>[C]
 O tidings of comfort and joy
 Comfort and joy
 O tidings of comfort and joy

[V1]
 God rest ye merry gentlemen
 Let nothing you dismay
 Remember Christ our Savior
 Was born on Christmas Day
 To save us all from Satan's pow'r
 When we were gone astray

[V2]
 In Bethlehem in Jewry
 This blessed Babe was born
 And laid within a manger
 Upon this blessed morn
 The which His mother Mary
 Did nothing take in scorn

[V3]
 From God our heavenly Father
 A blessed angel came
 And unto certain shepherds
 Brought tidings of the same
 How that in Bethlehem was born
 The Son of God by name

[V4]
 Fear not then said the angel
 Let nothing you affright
 This day is born a Savior
 Of a pure virgin bright
 To free all those who trust in Him
 From Satan's pow'r and might

[V5]
 The shepherds at those tidings
 Rejoiced much in mind
 And left their flocks afeeding
 In tempest storms and wind
 And went to Bethlehem straightway
 The blessed Babe to find

[V6]
 And when they came to Bethlehem
 Where our dear Savior lay
 They found Him in a manger
 Where oxen feed on hay
 His mother Mary kneeling down
 Unto the Lord did pray

[V7]
 Now to the Lord sing praises
 All you within this place
 And with true love and brotherhood
 Each other now embrace
 This holy tide of Christmas
 All others doth deface</lyrics>
