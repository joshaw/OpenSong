.D      Dsus4   D   Dsus2         D    Dsus4    D
 Sing a song of celebration, lift up a shout of praise
.                        G Gsus4 G            D   Dsus4 D
 For the Bridegroom will come    the glorious one;
.    C  G                    D    Dsus4 D
 And oh, we will look on his face,
.      C G                 D     Dsus4 D Dsus2
 We'll go to a much better place.

[V2]
.D          Dsus4    D      Dsus2        D         Dsus4    D
 Dance with all your might, lift up your hands and clap for joy:
.                   G Gsus4 G              D    Dsus4 D
 The time's drawing near    when He will appear;
.     C  G                     D    Dsus4 D
 And, oh, we will stand by His side,
.  C      G              Asus4 A
 A strong, pure spotless bride.

.D       C            G                D
 We will dance on the streets that are golden,
.    D        C             G            D
 The glorious bride and the great Son of man;
.     D     C          G         D
 From ev'ry tongue and tribe and nation
.      C   G                   D    Dsus4 D Dsus2
 We'll join in the song of the Lamb.</lyrics></song>
