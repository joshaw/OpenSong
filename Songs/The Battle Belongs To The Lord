.   Em                   D         Em
 In heavenly armor we'll enter the land,
.             D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord;
.   Em                       D              Em
 No weapon that's fashioned against us will stand,
.             D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord!

 Power, and strength to the Lord;
.Em D    G  D   C D G
 We sing glory, honor,

.         Em                      D         Em
 When the power of darkness comes in like a flood,
.             D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord;
.     Em                        D            Em
 He's raised up a standard, the power of His blood,
.             D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord!

[V3]
.          Em               D           Em
 When your enemy presses in hard do not fear,
.             D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord;
.     Em                         D           Em
 Take courage, my friend, your redemption is near,
.             D            Em
 The battle belongs to the Lord!</lyrics></song>
