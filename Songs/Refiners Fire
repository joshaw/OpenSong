  <lyrics>[V]
.D   A     Bm
 Purify my heart,
.             Em7
 Let me be as gold,
.    A
 And precious silver;
.D   A     Bm
 Purify my heart,
.             Em7
 Let me be as gold,
.D    A
 Pure gold.

.D G       A
 Refiner's fire,
.D          G     A
 My heart's one desire,
.      D   A
 Is to be, Holy:
.D    G        A
 Set apart for You, Lord;
.            D   A
 I choose to be, Holy:
.D    G        Bm     A
 Set apart for You my Master,
.Em       A       D
 Ready to do Your will.</lyrics></song>
