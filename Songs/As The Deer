  <lyrics>[V1]
.C      G            Am      E           F            G     C    Am G
 As the deer panteth for the water so my soul longeth after You; 
.C    G           Am        E          F       G       C    Am G
 You alone are my heart’s desire and I long to worship You. 

[C]
.Am               F            C          F                 Dm     E       
 You alone are my strength, my shield; to You alone will my spirit yield;
.C    G           Am        E          F       G       C     
 You alone are my heart’s desire and I long to worship You.

[V2]
.C         G               Am     E            F          G     C     Am G
 You’re my friend, and You are my brother|even though You are a King; 
.C      G             Am  E              F         G  C      Am G
 I love You more than any other, so much more than anything. 

[V3]
.C      G             Am      E            F       G    C   Am G
 I want You more than gold or silver; only You can satisfy; 
.C    G            Am       E             F     G     C    Am G
 You alone are the real joy giver and the apple of my eye.</lyrics></song>
