  <lyrics>[V]
.E7        A7
 I know He rescued my soul,
.E7            A7
 His blood has covered my sin,
.    E7   A7    E7   A7
 I believe, I believe;
.E7            A7
 My shame He's taken away,
.E7         A7
 My pain is healed in His name,
.    E7   A7    E7   A7
 I believe, I believe.
