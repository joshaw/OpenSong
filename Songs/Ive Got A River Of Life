.G                                C      G
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me!
.G                 Em            A        D7
 Makes the lame to walk, and the blind to see;
.G                            C        G
 Opens prison doors, sets the captives free!
.G                        Em      G/D D  G
 I've got a river of life flowing out of me!

[2]
.                             G
 Spring up, O well, within my soul!
.                               D
 Spring up, O well, and make me whole!
.             G
 Spring up, O well, and give to me,
.C    G     D      G
 That life abundantly.</lyrics></song>
