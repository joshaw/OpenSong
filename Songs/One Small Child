1One small Child in a     land of a  thousand,|One small dream of a   Savior    tonight,
2One king  bringing his   gold and   riches,|  One king  ruling an    army of   might,
3One small light from the flame of a candle,|  One small light from a city of   might, 
4One small Child in a     land of a  thousand,|One small dream in a   people of might,

.Em        D              Em           D              Em        D            Em D Em D Em D Em
1One small hand reaching  out to the   star light,|   One small city of      li________fe. Ooohhh.
2One king  kneeling with  incense and  candle light,| One King  brining us   li________fe. Ooohhh.||
3One small light from the stars in the endless night,|One small light from a fa________ce. Ooohhh.||
4One small hand reaching  out to the   star light,|   One small Savior of    li________fe. Ooohhh.

.G       D/G      G      D/G            G       D/F#     Em A    D
2See Him lying, a cradle beneath Him;   See Him smiling  in the  stall.
3See the shepherds kneeling before Him; See the kings on bending knee.

.G       D/G    G            D/G     G       D/F#    Em A    D
2See His mother praising His Father; See His tiny    eyelids fall.
3See His mother praising His Father; See the Blessed In_fant sleep.</lyrics></song>
