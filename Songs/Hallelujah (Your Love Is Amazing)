  <lyrics>[V1]
.              G                     C2
 Your love is amazing, steady, and unchanging,
.               Dsus                      C2
 Your love is a mountain, firm beneath my feet;
.               G                       C2
 Your love is a mystery, how You gently lift me,
.             Dsus                       C2
 When I am surrounded, Your love carries me.
 
[C]
.     G           Dsus
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
.     Em7    C2
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing;
.     G           Dsus
 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
.     Em7    C2
 Hallelujah, Your love makes me sing.
 
[V2]
.                G                      C2
 Your love is surprising, I can feel it rising,
.                   Dsus                   C2
 All the joy that's growing deep inside of me;
.             G                          C2
 Every time I see You, all Your goodness shines through,
.                    Dsus                   C2
 And I can feel this God song, rising up in me.</lyrics>
