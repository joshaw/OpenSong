.G     C     G/B       Am  Em/G
 He is able, more than able

 To accomplish what concerns me today.

 He is able, more than able

 To handle anything that comes my way.

 He is able, more than able
.   C                 E7           Am7   Fm7
 To do much more than I could ever dream,

 He is able, more than able,
.   Dm7             G           C
 To make me what He wants me to be.</lyrics></song>
