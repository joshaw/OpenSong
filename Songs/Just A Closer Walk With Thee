[V]
.G          Em       G        Am     D
1I am       weak but Thou art strong;
2Thro' this world of toil and snares,
3When this  feeble   life is  o'er,
.D                   Dsus G
1Jesus keep me from  all  wrong.
2If I faulter, Lord  who  cares?
3Time for me will be no   more;
.G        Em             C2
1I'll be  satisfied as   long
2Who with me my burden   shares?
3Guide me gently, safely o'er
.         G            D          Dsus G
1As I     walk, let me walk close to   Thee.
2None but Thee, dear   Lord, none but  Thee.
3To Thy   kingdom      shore, to  Thy  shore.

[C]
.G      Em     G         Am   D
 Just a closer walk with Thee,
.D                   Dsus G
 Grant it, Jesus, is my   plea.
.G     Em               C2
 Daily walking close to Thee,
.       G        D         Dsus G
 Let it be, dear Lord, let it   be.</lyrics></song>
