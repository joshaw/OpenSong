.G                   D/A      C
1I'm pressing on the upward   way,
2My heart has no de__sire to  stay
3I want to live a____bove the world,
4I want to scale the utmost   height
.                G        G/B      D
1New heights I'm gaining  every    day;
2Where doubts a__rise and fears dismay;
3Tho' Satan's    darts at me are   hurled;
4And catch a     gleam of glory    bright;
.               G           D/A         C
1Still praying  as I'm      onward      bound,
2Tho' some may  dwell where these a_____bound,
3For faith has  caught the  joyful      sound,
4But still I'll pray 'till  heav'n I've found,
.               G/D           D  G
1"Lord plant my feet on high__er ground."
2My prayer, my  aim, is high__er ground.
3The song of    saints on higher ground.
4"Lord lead me  on to high____er ground."

.              G             D
 Lord, lift me up and let me stand
.                           G
 By faith on heaven's table-land;
.                           C
 A higher plane than I have found--
.               G/D         D  G
 Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.</lyrics></song>
