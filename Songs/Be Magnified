.G      Em            D           Am    G/B C   D    Em
1I have made You too  small in my eyes, O   Lord, forgive me;
2I have leaned on the wisdom of   men,  O   Lord, forgive me;
.Em/B Em       D           Am    G/B  C             D              Em
1And  I have believed in a lie,  That You were un___able to        help me.
2And  I have responded to  them, In___stead of Your light and Your mercy.
