 All creatures of our God and King
 Lift up your voice and with us sing
 Alleluia alleluia
 Thou burning sun with golden beam
 Thou silver moon with softer gleam
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V2]
 Thou rushing wind that art so strong
 Ye clouds that sail in heaven along
 O praise Him alleluia
 Thou rising morn in praise rejoice
 Ye lights of evening find a voice
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V3]
 Thou flowing water pure and clear
 Make music for thy Lord to hear
 Alleluia alleluia
 Thou fire so masterful and bright
 Thou givest man both warmth and light
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V4]
 And all ye men of tender heart
 Forgiving others take your part
 O sing ye alleluia
 Ye who long pain and sorrow bear
 Praise God and on Him cast your care
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V5]
 Let all things their Creator bless
 And worship Him in humbleness
 O praise Him alleluia
 Praise praise the Father praise the Son
 And praise the Spirit Three in One
 O praise Him O praise Him||

 Earth ever fertile day by day

 All fruit and crops that richly grow
 All trees and flowers God's glory show
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V7]
 People and nations take your part
 Love and forgive with all your heart
 Alleluia alleluia
 All who long pain and sorrow bear
 Trust God and cast on Him your care
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

 Death once the ancient enemy
 Hear now our Easter melody
 O praise Him alleluia
 You are the pathway home to God
 Our door to life through Christ our Lord
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V9]
 Praise God from whom all blessings flow
 Praise Him all creatures here below
 O praise Him alleluia
 Praise Him above ye heavenly hosts
 Praise Father Son and Holy Ghost
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V10]
 Dear mother earth who day by day
 Unfoldest blessings on our way
 O praise Him alleluia
 The flowers and fruits that in Thee grow
 Let them His glory also show
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia

[V11]
 And thou most kind and gentle death
 Waiting to hush our latest breath
 O praise Him Alleluia
 Thou leadest home the child of God
 And Christ our Lord the way hath trod
 O praise Him O praise Him||
 Alleluia alleluia alleluia</lyrics></song>
