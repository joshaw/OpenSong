.           Bb                       Eb           Bb
1You're the Lion of Judah, the       Lamb Who was slain,
2There's a  shield in our hand and a sword at our side,
.                                  Eb             F
1You ascended to heaven and        evermore shall reign;
2There's a fire in our spirit that cannot be de___nied;
.       Bb                      Eb             Bb
1At the end of the age when the earth You re___claim,
2As the Father has told us for  these you have died,
.                              F
1You will gather the nations before You.||
2For the nations will gather before you.||
.                                                          Eb   F
1And the eyes of all men will be fixed on the Lamb Who was crucified,
2And the ears of all men need to hear of the Lamb Who was  crucified,
.                                                             Eb       F
1For with wisdom and mercy and justice He reigns at the       Father's side.
2Who went down to the grave yet was raised up to reign at the Father's side.

.        Bb                Eb   Bb  F
 And the angels will cry, "Hail the Lamb
.        Bb                   Eb   Bb F
 Who was slain for the world; rule in power!"
.        Bb                  Eb  Bb    F
 And the earth shall reply, "You shall reign
.       Bb                        Eb      F   Bb
 As the King of all kings and the Lord of all lords!"</lyrics></song>
