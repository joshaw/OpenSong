.       C                  F
 When I look into Your holiness,
.       C                    F
 When I gaze into Your loveliness;
.             C              Em
 When all the things that surround
.       F                       Dm  G
 Become shadows in the light of You.||

.       C                              F
 When I found the joy of reaching Your heart,
.        C                               F
 When my will becomes enthralled in Your Love;
.             C              Em
 When all the things that surround
.       F                       Dm  G
 Become shadows in the light of You.

.G         F   G          Em  Am
 I worship You, I worship You;
.    F              G
 The reason I live,
.              C   Dm C
 Is to worship You.</lyrics></song>
