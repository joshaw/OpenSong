[1]
.Am         Dm
 You are my hiding place,
.G          C                  F          Dm
 You always fill my heart with songs of deliverence,
.    E                                Am
 Whenever I am afraid I will trust in You.

[2]
.Dm              G
 I will trust in You,
.C                 F             Dm
 Let the weak say, "I am strong."
.       E                                     Am
 In the strength of the Lord, I will trust in You.</lyrics></song>
