.G            C               Dsus          C
 Every move I make, I make in You: You make me move, Jesus,
.G              C              Dsus    C
 Every breath I take, I breath in You;
.G            C               Dsus         C
 Every step I take, I take in You: You are my way, Jesus,
.G              C                 Dsus C
 Every breath I take, I breath in You.

 Waves of mercy, waves of grace,

 Everywhere I look I see Your *****face;

 Your love has captured me,

 O my God, this love, how can it *******be?
