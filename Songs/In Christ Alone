1In    Christ  alone my    hope is found,|He is my     light, my strength, my song.
2In    Christ  alone! who  took on flesh,|Fullness of  God in    helpless     babe!
3There in the   ground His body    lay,|  Light of the world by  darkness     slain.
4(x2)No    guilt in life, no   fear in death,|This is the  power of  Christ in    me!

1This Corner_______stone, this solid    Ground,|Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.||
2This Gift of      love and    righteousness,|  Scorned by the   ones He  came to     save.||
3Then bursting     forth in    glorious Day,|   Up from the the  grave He rose a______gain!||
4From life's first cry to      final    breath,|Jesus com________mands my desti_______ny!||

1What heights of love, what depths of peace!|When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!
2Till on that    cross as   Jesus     died,|The   wrath of  God was       satis_____fied.
3And  as He      stands in  victo_____ry,|Sin's   curse has lost it's     grip on   me!
4No   power of   hell, no   scheme of man,|Can    ever      pluck me      from His  hand!
 
.     A     E        A        B     E/G#            A        F#m7        E
1My   Comforter, my  All in   All,| Here in the     love of  Christ I    stand.
2For  every sin on   Him was  laid:|Here in the     death of Christ I    live.
3For  I am  His and  He in    mine,|Bought with the precious blood of    Christ.
4Till He re_turns or calls me home,|Here in the     power of Christ I'll stand!</lyrics>
