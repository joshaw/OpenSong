.G              D              Em            C     D      G
 I want to see, I want to see, I want to see Jesus lifted high!
.G              D              Em            C     D      G
 I want to see, I want to see, I want to see Jesus lifted high!

[V1]
.G             D            Em
 I want to see Jesus lifted high,
.              C      D         G
 A banner that flies across the sky;
.G                  D                 Em
 That all men might see the truth and know,
.          C      D      G
 He is the way to heaven.

[C2]
.G               D               Em             C     D      G
 We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high!
.G               D               Em             C     D      G
 We want to see, we want to see, we want to see Jesus lifted high!

[V2]
.G       D                 Em
 Step by step we're moving forward,
.          C            D      G
 Little by little we're taking ground;
.G     D                    Em
 Every prayer is a powerful weapon,
.                 C
 Strongholds come tumbling down,
.    D
 And down and down and down...

[C3]
.G                D                Em              C     D      G
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see, we're gonna see Jesus lifted high!
.G                D                Em              C     D      G
 We're gonna see, we're gonna see, we're gonna see Jesus lifted high!</lyrics></song>
