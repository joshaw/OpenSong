.G                                              C                      G
 I believe in faithfulness, I believe in giving of myself,|For someone else;
.G                                              C                           G
 I believe in peace and love, I believe in honesty and trust,|but it's not enough;
.    D                            G                 C          G               D
 For all that I believe may never change the way it is,|unless I believe Jesus lives.

[C]
.               G                 C               G             C           G            D
 Where there is faith, there is a voice calling,|"Keep walking, you're not alone in this world;"||
.               G                 C            G              C        G          D
 Where there is faith, there is a peace like a child sleeping|hope everlasting in He
.               G          C         Am         D          G
 Who is able to bear every burden to heal every hurt in my heart;
.        C          G        D                     G
 It is a wonderful, powerful place: where there is faith.

[V2]
.G                                                      C                     G
 There's a man across the sea, never heard the sound of freedom ring,|Only in his dreams;
.G                                                  C                      G
 There's a lady dressed in black, in a motorcade of Cadillacs,|Daddy's not coming back;
.        D                            G               C               G                     D
 And our hearts begin to fall and our stability grows weak,|But Jesus meets our needs if we only believe.</lyrics></song>
