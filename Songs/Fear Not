  <lyrics>[1]
.      Bm
 "Fear not, for I am with you,"
.      G
 "Fear not, for I am with you,"
.      Em
 "Fear not, for I am with you,"
.         Bm   A
 Says the Lord.

[2]
.D
 I have redeemed you
.       F#m
 I have called you by name:
.G              D    A
 Child, you are mine;
.         D
 When you walk through the waters
.F#m
 I will be there,
.G            D      A
 And thru the flames.

[3]
.       Bm               F#m
 You'll not (No way!) be drowned!
.       Bm               F#m
 You'll not (No way!) be burned!
.    G A       D   A
 For I am with you.</lyrics></song>
