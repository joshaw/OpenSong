  <lyrics>[V1]
 From the squalor of a borrowed stable,
 By the Spirit and a virgin's faith;
 To the anguish and the shame of scandal
 Came the Saviour of the human race.||
 But the skies were filled with the praise of heaven,
 Shepherds listen as the angels tell
 Of the Gift of God come down to man
 At the dawning of Immanuel.
 
[V2]
 King of heaven now the Friend of sinners,
 Humble servant in the Father's hands,
 Filled with power and the Holy Spirit,
 Filled with mercy for the broken man.||
 Yes, He walked my road and He felt my pain,
 Joys and sorrows that I know so well;
 Yet His righteous steps give me hope again -
 I will follow my Immanuel.
 
[V3]
 Through the kisses of a friend's betrayal,
 He was lifted on a cruel cross;
 He was punished for a world's transgressions,
 He was suffering to save the lost.||
 He fights for breath, He fights for me,
 Loosing sinners from the claims of hell;
 And with a shout our souls are free -
 Death defeated by Immanuel.
 
[V4]
 Now He's standing in the place of honour,
 Crowned with glory on the highest throne,
 Interceding for His own beloved
 Till His Father calls to bring them home!||
 Then the skies will part as the trumpet sounds
 Hope of heaven or the fear of hell;
 But the Bride will run to her Lover's arms,
 Giving glory to Immanuel!</lyrics></song>
