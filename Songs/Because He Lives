  <lyrics>[V1]
.G                                  C                  G                   Am   D7
 God sent His Son, |they called Him Jesus, |He came to love, |heal, and forgive;
.             G               C                G                 D7               G
 He lived and died |to buy my pardon;|An empty grave is there to prove |my Savior lives.

[C]
.           G                   C
 Because He lives, I can face tomorrow,
.           G                  D7
 Because He lives, all fear is gone;
.          G D7 G7              C
 Because I know___ He holds the future,
.            G                 D7              G
 And life is worth the living |just because He lives.

[V2]
.G                            C                  G                Am    D7
 How sweet to hold |a newborn baby |and feel the pride and joy He gives;
.            G                 C                      G              D7               G
 But greater still |the calm assurance|This child can face uncertain days |because He lives.

[V3]
.G                                 C                         G              Am   D7
 And then one day |I'll cross that river; |I'll fight life's final war with pain;
.            G                   C                     G                D7               G
 And then as death |gives way to vict'ry,|I'll see the lights of glory |and I'll know He lives.</lyrics>
