.E        D                    A/C#                    E
 It's the song of the redeemed rising from the African plain.
.         D                    A/C#                    E
 It's the song of the forgiven drowning out the Amazon rain.||
.            D               A/C#                   E
 The song of Asian believers filled with God's holy fire.
.                        D                       A/C#                         E
 It's ev'ry tribe, ev'ry tongue, ev'ry nation;|a love song born of a grateful choir.

[C]
.                                  D             A              E
 It's all God's children singing,|"Glory, glory, hallelujah!|He reigns, He reigns!"
.                                  D             A              E
 It's all God's children singing,|"Glory, glory, hallelujah!|He reigns, He reigns!"

[V2]
.       D                          A/C#                      E
 Let it rise above the four winds, caught up in the heavenly sound.
.                          D                           A/C#                   E
 Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals|to the faithful gathered underground.||
.                               D                 A/C#                  E
 Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation,|some were meant to persist.
.                             D                  A/C#                  E
 Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples,|none rings truer than this:

[B]
.            A/E                D/F#                         E
 And all the powers of darkness tremble at what they've just heard,
.               A/E                D/F#                     E
 'Cause all the powers of darkness can't drown out a single word.</lyrics></song>
