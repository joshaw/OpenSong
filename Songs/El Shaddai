.       Em          A/C#      D        G
 El Shaddai, El Shaddai, El Elyonna Adonai,
.       C                    A            Bm    A/C#    B/D#
 Age to age You're still the same, by the power of the *name.
.       Em          A7/C#     D       G
 El Shaddai, El Shaddai, erkamkana Adonai,
.        C                   A     Asus   D
 We will praise and lift You high, El Shaddai.

[V1]
.             Em                   A                  D          G
 Through Your love and through the ram, You saved the son of Abraham,
.            C             A                   Bm    A/C#    B/D#
 Through the power of Your hand You turned the sea into dry *land.
.       Em             A                 D              G
 To the outcast on her knees You are the God who really sees,
.    C                 A                 D    DsusD
 And by Your might You set Your children free.

[V2]
.            Em                A              D                  G
 Through the years You made it clear that the time of Christ was near,
.           C               A           Bm   A/C#     B/D#
 Though the people couldn't see what Messiah ought to be.
.            Em                 A               D              G
 Though Your Word contained the plan, they just could not understand,
.          C                A           Bm      A       B
 Your most awesome work was done in the frailty of Your Son.</lyrics></song>
