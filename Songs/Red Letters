.C      Fm
 Pages, Filled with the holy message
.Fm
 Sealed with a kiss from heaven
.     C            G
 On a scroll, long ago
.C        Fm
 Phrases, words that were bound together
.Fm        
 Now have the power to sever
.       C          G
 Like a sword, evermore

[P]
.Eb              
 Heed the words divinely spoken
.Gm
 May your restless heart be broken
.Cm                        Fm  Eb  Dm
 Let the supernatural take hold

[C]
.         C           Ab  Fm
 There is love in the red letters
.         C            Ab  Fm
 There is truth in the red letters
.         Eb
 There is hope for the hopeless
.G
 Peace and forgiveness
.         Ab              Fm
 There is life in the red letters
.           C
 In the red letters

[V2]
.C       Fm
 One man came to reveal a mystery
.Fm
 Changing the course of history
.         C            G
 Made the claim he was God
.C        Fm 
 Ageless, born of a virgin Mary
.Fm
 Spoke with a voice that carried
.            C             G
 through the years it persevered
