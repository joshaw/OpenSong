.E                       A       E                       B
1Who is moving on the    waters? Who is holding up the   moon?
2Who is He that makes me happy?  Who is He that gives me peace?
.E                        A        C#m                        B
1Who is peeling back the  darkness, with the burning light of noon?
2Who is He that brings me comfort,  and turns the bitter into sweet?
.E                      A         E                      B
1Who is standing on the mountains? Who is on the earth below?
2Who is stirring up my  passion?   Who is rising up in   me?
.C#m            B        A       E        A            B    E
1Who is bigger  than the heavens, and the Lover of my  soul?
2Who is filling up my    hunger,   with   everything I need?

.A                  C#m    B                      E
 Creator God, He is Yahweh, The Great I Am, He is Yahweh,
.A                      C#m    B E
 The Lord of All, He is Yahweh;
.A                     C#m    B                         E
 Rose of Sharon, He is Yahweh, The Righteous Son, He is Yahweh,
.A                       C#m    B
 The Three-in-one, He is Yahweh.

[B]
.A                 B      E       B             C#m   B
 You are holy and eternal, and forever You will reign;
.A                     B                              C#m            A
 Every knee will bow before You, every tongue will confess Your name;
.A                       B     E        B                 C#m    B
 All the angels give You glory, as they stand before Your throne,
.A                    B      A                      B    E
 And here on earth we gather, to declare Your name alone.</lyrics></song>
