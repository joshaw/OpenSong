E                     B/D# Here I am to worship, here I am to bow down,.             E/G#               A Here I am to say that You're my God;.                  E                  B/D# You're altogether lovely, altogether worthy,.           E/G#         A Altogether wonderful to me. [V2].E           Bsus        F#m King of all days, oh so highly exalted,.E           Bsus    E/A Glorious in Heaven above;.E          Bsus        F#m Humbly You came to the earth You created,.E              Bsus        E/A All for love’s sake became poor. [B].           B/D#  E/G#     A (And) I'll never know how much it cost.   B/D#   E/G# A To see my sin upon that cross.</lyrics>  <hymn_number></hymn_number>  <capo print="false"></capo>  <key></key>  <aka></aka>  <key_line></key_line>  <user1></user1>  <user2></user2>  <user3></user3>  <tempo></tempo>  <time_sig></time_sig></song>
