  <lyrics>[V1]
.          D      G          D              G        E7          A    A7
 Blessed Assurance, Jesus is mine! O what a foretaste of glory divine!
.           D     G              D                Em    A                D       
 Heir of Salvation, purchased of God, Born of His Spirit, |washed in His blood.

.           D     G           D      
 This is my story, this is my song,
.            G      E            A     A7
 Praising my Savior all the day long;
.           D     G           D      
 This is my story, this is my song,
.            Em     A            D      
 Praising my Savior all the day long.
 
[V2]
.           D      G           D                  G      E7                A      A7
 Perfect submission, perfect delight! |Visions of rapture |now burst in my sight;
.          D      G             D               Em    A            D      
 Angels descending, bring from above |Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
 
[V3]
.         D       G           D              G      E7            A      A7
 Perfect obedience, all is at rest, |I in my Savior, am happy and blest;
.             D      G          D                      Em      A             D
 Watching and waiting, looking above, |Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.</lyrics>
