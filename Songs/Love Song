  <lyrics>[V1]
.Em                       C 
 Ive heard it said that a man would climb a mountain 
.D                   G      B7 
 Just to be with the one he loves 
.Em                    C 
 How many times has he broken that promise 
.D                 G 
 It has never been done 

[P1]
.           C                   G
 I've never climbed the highest mountain 
.      C                       D
 But I walked the hill of Calvary 

[C]
.G                              D 
 Just to be with you I would do anything 
.          C                 G   D 
 Theres no price I would not pay 
.G                                D 
 Just to be with you I would give everything 
.        C            Em   D 
 I would give my life away 

[V2]
.Em                       C 
 I've heard it said that a man would swim the ocean 
.D                   G      B7 
 Just to be with the one he loves 
.Em                           C 
 Well all those dreams are an empty emotion 
.D               G 
 It can never be done 

[P2]
.           C                G 
 I've never swam the deepest ocean 
.      C                      D 
 But I walked upon the raging sea 
---
[B]
.      Bm                                 Em 
 And I know that you dont understand the fullness of my love 
.      C                            G 
 How I died upon the cross for your sins 
.      Bm                              Em 
 And I know that you dont realize how much I gave you 
.      C                          D 
 And I promise I would do it all again 

[CEnd]
.G                             D 
 Just to be with you I've done everything 
.          C               G  D
 Theres no price I did not pay 
.G                           D 
 Just to be with you I gave everything 
.      C            Em   D 
 Yes I gave my life away 
.               Em   D 
 I gave my life away.</lyrics></song>
