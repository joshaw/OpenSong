  <lyrics>[V1]
.             D    Dmaj7                        G2
 I can only imagine what it will be like when I walk by your side;
.             D    Dmaj7                            G2
 I can only imagine what my eyes will see when Your face is before me;
.             D     A            D
 I can only imagine; I can only imagine.

[C]
.   G2                          A
 Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel?
.       D
 Will I dance for You Jesus or in awe of You be still?
.       G2                              A
 Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall?
.       D
 Will I sing hallelujah, will I be able to speak at all?
.            G2    A             D
 I can only imagine; I can only imagine.

[V2]
.             D    Dmaj7                      G2
 I can only imagine when that day comes and I find myself standing in the Son;
.             D    Dmaj7                     G2
 I can only imagine when all I will do is forever, forever worship You;
.             D     A            D
 I can only imagine; I can only imagine.</lyrics></song>
