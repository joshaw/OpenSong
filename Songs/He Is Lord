.E     F#m   B     E            E     E/D#     C#m            F#m  B
 He is Lord, He is Lord!|He has risen from the dead and He is Lord!
.      E          E7         A         Am        E     B         E
 Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess|that Jesus Christ is Lord!
 
 
[V1]
.E              B      A            E      A                B            E
 Emptied of His glory, God became a man|To walk on earth in ridicule and shame;
.  A           B          C#m            F#      E               B          E
 A Ruler yet a Servant, a Shepherd yet a Lamb,|A Man of sorrows, agony, and pain.
 
[V2]
.E             B       A            E        A                 B              E
 Humbled and rejected, beaten and despised,|Upon the cross the Son of God was slain;
.     A              B            C#m          F#        E                B               E
 Just like a lamb to slaughter: a sinless Sacrifice,|But by His death His loss became our gain.
 
 
[V3]
.E              B        A             E         A                   B              E
 Satan's forces crumbled like a mighty wall,|The stone that held Him in was rolled aside;
.    A                 B         C#m         F#       E                B             E
 The Prince of Life in glory was lifted over all,|Now earth and heaven echo with the cry!
 
[CFinal]
.E       F#m   B       E              E     E/D#     C#m              F#m  B
 You are Lord, You are Lord!|You have risen from the dead and You are Lord!
.       E          E7          A         Am        E     B         E
 And my knee shall bow, and my tongue confess|that Jesus Christ is Lord!
 
 
 He is Lord He is Lord
 He is risen from the dead
 And He is Lord
 Every knee shall bow
 Every tongue confess
 That Jesus Christ is Lord</lyrics>
