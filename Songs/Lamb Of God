  <lyrics>[V1]
.          D   G          D                  Bm  G              A
 Your only Son, no sin to hide; but You have sent Him from Your side,
.         G  A            Bm G         D        A       D
 To walk upon this guilty sod and to become the Lamb of God.

[V2]
.             D   G          D                      Bm     G          A
 Your Gift of Love they crucified; they laughed and scorned Him as He died;
.           G    A             Bm   G         D         A       D
 The humble King, they named a fraud|and sacrificed the Lamb of God.

[C]
.          Bm   G             D
 O Lamb of God, sweet Lamb of God;
.           Bm   G       A
 I love the holy Lamb of God;
.          G  A            Bm     G
 O wash me in His precious blood;
.         D           A       D
 My Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God.

[V3]
.         D   G              D                 Bm     G           A
 I was so lost I should have died but You have brought me to Your side,
.          G A               Bm G          D        A       D
 To be led by Your staff and rod and to be called a lamb of God.</lyrics></song>
