.G       C                 D    C D
 Lord, I lift Your Name on high,

 Lord, I love to sing Your praises;
.G      C                 D    C D
 I'm so glad You're in my life,
.G      C                D       C D
 I'm so glad you came to save us.

.G             C         D        C        G
 You came from heaven to earth to show the way,
.G        C            D        C       G
 From the earth to the cross my debt to pay;
.         C            D
 From the cross to the grave,
.         Em           C
 From the grave to the sky,
.        D                 G    C D   C D G
 Lord, I lift Your Name on high.</lyrics></song>
