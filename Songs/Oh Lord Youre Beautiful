.   D            G/D   D   Asus A
1Oh Lord, You're beau__ti__ful;
2Oh Lord, please light the fire
.     D           G      D/F# Asus A
1Your face is     all    I    seek;||
2That once burned bright and  clear;
.    Bm        F#/A#    Bm A/C#  D
1And when Your eyes are on this  child,
2Re__place the lamp of  my first love,
.     Em7        Asus   A  Dsus D
1Your grace a____bounds to me.
2That burns with holy      fear.

.          G    D/F# Em   D   A/C#     A    D
 I want to take Your Word and shine it all around,
.                  G       E/G#     Asus A
 But first help me just to live it, Lord;||
.             G D/F# Em               A/C#         F#/A#
 And when I'm doing  well, help me to never seek a crown,
.         Bm             A        G2 D
 For my reward is giving glory to You.</lyrics>
